# MatrixTransposition
Lab for Parallel Programming class implementing three different matrix calculations using CUDA.

## Project Explanation
The goal of this project is to compute matrix calculations while utilizing the CUDA parallel environment. Details regarding each lab are available in the PDF.
* Lab 1 involves parallelizing a matrix calculation that has loop dependencies preventing mass parallelization. 
* Lab 2 involves multiplying a large matrix by it's transpose. There are no loop dependencies so mass parallelization is possible.
* Lab 3 involves computing the transpose of a matrix. Again, no loop dependencies so mass parallelization is possible.
